# Snake-AI
Teaching an AI to play the snake game using neural networks. Snake game will be made using a python library called pygame. 

## The Game
The snake game is a very popular game in which the objective is for the "the snake" to acquire the "apple." Once it "eats" the apple, the snake becomes longer. The game ends when:
 - The snake collides with its own body
 - The snake collides with the wall (The wall generator can be turned off in this version, and the snake will just simply pass through and show up on the other side)

Here is a clip of the Snake game generated using pygame (code is included in the repo):
